The Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) was a constellation of polar orbiting weather satellites
funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation
of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with the intent of improving the accuracy and detail of weather analysis and
forecasting.[1] The spacecraft were provided by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), and NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center oversaw the manufacture, integration and test of the NASA-provided TIROS satellites.[2] The first polar-orbiting
weather satellite launched as part of the POES constellation was the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N),
which was launched on 13 October 1978. The final spacecraft, NOAA-19 (NOAA-N Prime), was launched on 6 February 2009.[3]
The ESA-provided MetOp satellite operated by EUMETSAT utilize POES-heritage instruments for the purpose of data continuity.
The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1, now NOAA-20), which was launched on 18 November 2017, is the successor
to the POES Program.[4]
